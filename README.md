# Folkart-Preservation-Final
Final DSSA Project 

Overview
This repository contains the final projects for DSSA 2025 combining data science, digital mapping, and cultural preservation.
It includes two main components:

Folk Tale Sentiment Analysis (Python) – A natural language processing project analyzing over 2,900 global folk tales to uncover emotional and thematic patterns in cultural storytelling.

Tuckerton Seaport Educational Programming Dashboard (R Shiny) – An interactive mapping and visualization tool showcasing the reach, participation, and feedback from Tuckerton Seaport’s educational and folk art programs.

# Project 1 – Folk Tale Sentiment Analysis (Python)
Description
Analyzes the sentiment of global folk tales using VADER sentiment analysis and LDA topic modeling. Examines how positive, negative, and neutral tones vary across nations and story themes.

Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing of 2,900+ folk tales

Sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral)

Visualizations of sentiment distribution overall and by nation

Topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to explore recurring themes

Inclusion of lesser-represented nations for cultural inclusivity

Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy

NLTK (VADER, stopwords)

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (LDA)

# Project 2 – Tuckerton Seaport Educational Programming Dashboard (R Shiny)
Description
An interactive dashboard visualizing the scope and community impact of Tuckerton Seaport’s folk art and educational programs. Integrates survey data, geospatial mapping, and program participation metrics.

Features
Interactive map displaying free programs, paid patrons, school tours, and artist residencies

Survey visualizations, including age group, familiarity with the Seaport, event discovery sources, and attendance patterns

Open-ended feedback table for community suggestions and qualitative responses

Cleaned and normalized data to ensure consistent visual output

Tech Stack
R, Shiny, dplyr, tidyverse

leaflet (interactive mapping)

ggplot2 (data visualization)

tidygeocoder and sf (geospatial processing)

DT (interactive tables)
